				Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King Robert I Baratheon, Protector of the Realm, and Lord Regent of the North was born at Winterfell in the year 263 AC.
				<br><br>
				Lord Eddard, who is also known as Ned, is the son of Lord Rickard and Lady Lyarra Stark. His siblings include Brandon, Benjen, and Lyanna Stark. Ned was fostered in the Vale by Lord Jon Arryn (alongside Robert Baratheon).
				<br><br>
				Following the death of his father and brother Brandon at the hands of Aerys II Targaryen, Ned joined Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn to secure a major victory against the crown at the Battle of the Bells. Following this battle, he married Catelyn Tully at Riverrun, and then helped lead a decisive victory at the trident, where Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was slain by Robert Baratheon.
				<br><br>
				Following the ascent of Robert I Baratheon to the Iron Throne and the death of John Arryn, Ned Stark was made hand of the king.
