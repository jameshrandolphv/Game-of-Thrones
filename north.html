					Lord Eddard Stark is Warden of the North, which is a sparsely populated region that is roughly a third of the land mass of Westeros. This region is bounded by the Sunset Sea to the west and the Shivering Sea to the east.
					<br><br>
					Eddard's seat is Winterfell, located in the center of the north and southwest of the wolfswood, which is the largest forest in the Seven Kingdoms.
					<br><br>
					It is not uncommon for thousands to die in the North during its long, harsh winters. Snows can reach depths of 40 ft, and snowfalls can even occur during the summer.
					<br><br>
					The northmen are descendents of the First Men, and their incomes come primarily from the trading of wool, hides, timer, and silver.
